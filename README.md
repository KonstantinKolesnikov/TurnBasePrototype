# TurnBasePrototype
The prototype features tactical game mechanics, allied characters, an enemy, and an interactive obstacle.

For each player character, several actions can be selected per turn. After pressing the end turn button, all actions are played one after another.

Each action has a speed value. The lower the number next to the action, the higher the priority it will have during the action play. If the character has already been assigned an action, then the speed value of the next action will be added to the last one, and so on. Actions with the same priority are played in random order.

Some actions for different objects are played simultaneously: obstacle movements, character movements when one of them slams into another.
